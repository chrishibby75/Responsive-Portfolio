            I'm pretty easy going and I love my family.  That's what first comes to mind when I have to describe myself.  There's a little more to me than that, though.
            <br>First, I'm a sports nut, especially with baseball.  My undying love for the <a href="https://www.mlb.com/redsox" target="_blank">Boston Red Sox</a> has all but taken over my family's life.  We watch almost every game and my wife and I have taken a trip to Boston just to watch the Red Sox play the Yankees.<br> 
            I have been married to my wife for almost six years.  We have two kids.  Kade, who is almost five, and Kieran, who is almost two years old.  These kids crack me up.<br>
            Kade will probably be the youngest astronomer in history.  Since he was barely three years old, he's been obsessed with the solar system and, specifically, planets.<br>
            Kieran loves Elmo and likes to play with anything that isn't one of his toys.

            I work at Marriott Vacations Worldwide as an Business Support and Processes Specialist.  I've been there for 15 years and my favorite thing about working there are the travel benefits.
            We've been on some great vacations and we have one to Orlando, Florida coming up next May.  No, we're probably not going to Disney World.
          </p>

            One last thing about me is my love for music.  I'll listen to just about anything, although my least favorite genre is Country.  I don't get Country.  It's twangy and it all sounds the same.<br>
            I love really hard rock and metal.  Some of my favorite bands are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyPZG6YGCqk" target="_blank">Anthrax</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2Qnpun90DQ" target="_blank">Stone Sour</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ya8dT7oC8qA" target="_blank">Sevendust</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nco_kh8xJDs" target="_blank">Alice in Chains</a></li>            
          </ul>
          
                <p>That was a little bit about me.  Feel free to contact me.  I'd love to learn about you.</p>
